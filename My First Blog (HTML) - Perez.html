        <h1>Historical Perspective on Computing</h1>
            <p>Looking back at time, computing goes way back to the old times. For example, the <b>Abacus</b> is a simple Babylonian invention that uses beads to calculate. Moving to the 19th century, Joseph Marie Jacquard made the <b>Jacquard Machine</b>, which inspired the following development of computers. It is an automated loom that uses punch cards to weave silk cloth automatically. Both of these inventions inspired the idea of what computing is today, the Abacus proposed the idea of creating a device to help solve computational problems while the Jacquard machine showed the potential of automating devices through programming which would influence programming and computer as today (Binary Logic).</p>

                <p>the 1820s, <b>Charles Babbage</b> started his first invention called the <b>Difference Engine</b> which was powered by steam, this project however failed because of the lack of funding from the government. Years later, he made his second invention <b>called Analytical Engine</b> which has been discussed as the first programmable computer using punch cards. At this time, Charles met <b>Ada Lovelace</b> (Deemed to be the first programmer), Lovelace became interested in the project of Charles Babbage which she helped by giving her vision of how the Analytical Engine can be programmed to solve Bernoullis Number and the potential of what programming could bring to the future.</p>

                <p>In 1942, <b>John Atanasoff</b> and his student <b>Clifford Berry</b> made the first digital computer which replaced mechanical parts with electronic parts, primarily, vacuum tubes which made computations much faster. The <b>ABC Machine</b> used a Base-2 binary system instead of the traditional, base-10 or decimal system that would become the foundation for todays programming.</p>

Alan's invention, the Turing Machine which can stimulate algorithms, and his contribution to cryptography, greatly contributed to the development of modern computers and programming.</p>

                <p>In 1945, the <b>ENIAC</b> (Electronic Number Integrator and Computer) was invented by <b>John Mauchly</b> and <b>J. Presert Ecker</b>. The ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer that at that time showed computational prowess which would inspire machines for the following years. Around this time, <b>Jon Von Neumann</b> an American Mathematician, proposed the <i>Jon Neumann Architecture</i> which founded how computers of today were built. In addition, he helped in creating the <b>EDVAC</b> (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) which has a stored program or instructions in the computer's memory, combining this with Neumann's  Von Neumann Architecture, became the main principle of designing modern computers.</p>

                <p>In 1947, <b>Transistors</b> were invented which replaced vacuum tubes as it is more efficient, consumed less power, and also smaller. This also led the way for High-Level programming languages such as <b>Fortran</b>, started to be used because of the transistor's much better computation power and efficiency especially when they created an integrated circuit where transistors were packed into one single circuit. Because of the increase in computation power, and high-level programming language, Fortran, started to become widely used by people to program applications to aid in solving computational problems.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to IT Basics</h1>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
                <p>- Hardware is a physical component of a computer that is used to either enter data using an input device(e.g.Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone,) or present the product of the data by an output device (e.g. Speaker, Monitor, Printer). The input data that was entered by the input device will then be stored and processed by the processing components of the computer (e.g. RAM, CPU, GPU, ssd/hard disk,) which would then present or display the output data/product using an output device.</p>

                        </div>
            <h3>Software</h3>
                <p>- Software is an application that is a set of programmed code that acts as instructions for the computer to follow. There are two types of software applications 1. Application Software and 2. Systems Software. [APPLICATION SOFTWARE] is used to make everyday life faster and more efficient compared to the traditional ways of doing tasks which would take a longer time compared to using an application. [SYSTEMS SOFTWARE] focuses on the operating system of the computer (e.g. windows, macOS, Linux), drivers, and utilities. The primary purpose of the operating system is to help manage computer data and help software communicate with hardware.</p>

                        </div>
            <h3>Networking</h3>
                <p>- Networking is the connection between computers to send, share, or store information/resources from one computer(e.g. personal desktop) to another(e.g. mobile phone, internet, server,) which could be done physically using a cable or wirelessly by signals.</p>

                        </div>
            <h3>Role of IT in modern organizations</h3>
                <p>- IT generally reduces our workload by making tasks automated which makes accomplishing faster and more efficient, but what is its role in modern organizations of today? Today organizations use Information Technology to increase productivity and efficiency in work enabling the organization to allocate some of the resources to other work. Data management along with Cybersecurity is another example that the biggest organization has. With the large volume of data that the big organizations gather, store, and process, they would have to protect it from getting stolen from hacking or data breaching by enforcing a cyber security system as it is a valuable asset of the organization, it would take them a long time if they were to manually compute all of the data so they implement the uses of Information technology in their work to ensure progress.</p>
